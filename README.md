## STORY

There are three kinds of people in the world:  those that wish to seek peace, those that wish to destroy it, and those that work for the highest bidder.

Meet THE SYNDICATE: an interantional crime organization raking in billions from drugs, child slavery, and late-night infomercials.  Those that get in the way are destroyed, without hesitation.  For small-time players, this is almost certainly means elimination, but for high-profile targets, a more...subtle...approach is necessary.

You are AGENT BROWNHORN, an elite solo-operative with a unique skill for
handling these difficult situations.

CONTROLS:  
* Move - Up, down, left, right --or-- WASD
* Release the BROWNHORN - Spacebar

### MISSION 1:  OPERATION PANTFLUTE 

SYNDICATE:  BROWNHORN, we've got a job for you.  I assume you're up for the
task?

BROWNHORN:  Of course.  Name the target.

SYNDICATE:  The PRIME MINISTER OF MOROCCO has recently become a thorn in our
side.  We need you to deal with him.

BROWNHORN:  You know I don't do assassinations.  Get someone else.

SYNDICATE:  We wouldn't have come to you if we didn't need your...talents.  His
firstborn is to be baptized this Sunday.

BROWNHORN:  The perfect setting for a more...disrespectful...solution.

SYNDICATE:  Exactly.  If you can sabbotage this baptism, the country should
erupt in civil war.

BROWNHORN:  Not a problem.  Consider it done.
